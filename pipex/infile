Bonuses will be evaluated only if your mandatory part is PERFECT.
By PERFECT we naturally mean that it needs to be complete, that it
cannot fail, even in cases of nasty mistakes like wrong uses, etc.
It means that if your mandatory part does not obtain ALL the points
during the grading, your bonuses will be entirely IGNORED.
